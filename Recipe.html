<h1> Ingredents for Pomfret Fish Rava Fry </h1>
<p>Ingredients: Pomfret fish, chilli powder, turmeric, garlic, rava, salt, oil, and other spices as needed.</p>
<h2> Steps to Make Pomfret Fish Rava Fry:</h2>
<p>
Clean the Fish:

Wash the pomfret thoroughly and make 2–3 shallow slits on both sides for the masala to seep in.

Prepare the Masala:

In a bowl, mix red chilli powder, turmeric powder, crushed garlic, and salt.

Add a little water or lemon juice to make a thick paste.

Marinate:

Apply the masala paste all over the fish, including inside the slits.

Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or more for better flavor).

Coat with Rava:

Take semolina (rava) on a plate.

Gently coat the marinated fish evenly on both sides.

Shallow Fry:

Heat oil in a flat pan on medium flame.

Place the coated fish and fry on both sides until golden brown and crispy.

Avoid high flame to prevent burning.

Serve:

Remove from the pan, place on a tissue to absorb extra oil.

Serve hot with onion rings and lemon wedges. </p>

  <h1> Ingredents for paneer barbecue </h1>
<p>Ingredients: Paneer – 200g,Capsicum (green/red/yellow) – 1 medium,Onion – 1 large, cut into chunks,Tomato – 1 medium, cut into chunks, Skewers – wooden or metal
 For Marinade:
Thick curd (yogurt) – 3 tbsp, Ginger-garlic paste – 1 tsp, Red chili powder – 1 tsp (adjust to taste), Turmeric powder – ¼ tsp, Garam masala – ½ tsp, Chaat masala – ½ tsp, Lemon juice – 1 tsp, Salt – to taste, Oil – 1 tbsp.</p>
<h2> Steps to Make paneer barbecue:</h2>
<p>Start by preparing the marinade. In a bowl, mix thick curd with ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, chaat masala, lemon juice, salt, oil, and, if you like, a bit of kasuri methi and mustard oil for added flavor. Stir everything well until you get a smooth, spicy marinade. Add the paneer cubes, along with the chopped capsicum, onion, and tomato. Gently coat everything with the marinade, making sure each piece is well covered. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes, or longer if possible, to soak in the flavors. Once marinated, thread the paneer and veggies alternately onto skewers. Preheat your grill, oven, or tawa. If you're using a grill or oven, cook at medium-high heat until the paneer is slightly charred and the vegetables are tender—usually about 10–15 minutes. If using a tawa, lightly grease it and cook the skewers on medium heat, turning occasionally for even grilling. Once done, sprinkle a little chaat masala on top and serve hot with green chutney and lemon wedges.</p>
