<h1> Ingredents for Pomfret Fish Rava Fry </h1>
<p>Ingredients: Pomfret fish, chilli powder, turmeric, garlic, rava, salt, oil, and other spices as needed.</p>
<h2> Steps to Make Pomfret Fish Rava Fry:</h2>
<p>
Clean the Fish:

Wash the pomfret thoroughly and make 2â€“3 shallow slits on both sides for the masala to seep in.

Prepare the Masala:

In a bowl, mix red chilli powder, turmeric powder, crushed garlic, and salt.

Add a little water or lemon juice to make a thick paste.

Marinate:

Apply the masala paste all over the fish, including inside the slits.

Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or more for better flavor).

Coat with Rava:

Take semolina (rava) on a plate.

Gently coat the marinated fish evenly on both sides.

Shallow Fry:

Heat oil in a flat pan on medium flame.

Place the coated fish and fry on both sides until golden brown and crispy.

Avoid high flame to prevent burning.

Serve:

Remove from the pan, place on a tissue to absorb extra oil.

Serve hot with onion rings and lemon wedges. </p>
