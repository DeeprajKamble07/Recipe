<p>Hi! I'm Hello , the face behind this blog — a passionate home cook from the coastal town of Karwar. While I love preparing traditional fish recipes using fresh seafood from the Arabian Sea, my kitchen is not limited to just that!</p>
<p>I also enjoy cooking a variety of vegetarian dishes, snacks, and homestyle comfort food that anyone can make and enjoy. Whether it’s a spicy pomfret rava fry, a simple dal, or a quick tea-time snack, I aim to bring you easy, tasty, and authentic recipes with a touch of local flavor.</p>
<p>This blog is a space where I share my cooking videos, step-by-step recipes, and little kitchen tips that I've learned over the years. Most of what I make is inspired by everyday Indian cooking — no fancy equipment, just real food from a real kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Thank you for visiting! </b>I hope you enjoy the recipes and videos. Don’t forget to try them at home and share your feedback!</p>
